# Network Lab 2: Performance Evaluation of HTTP Protocols

## Lab 2 Overview
**Aim of Lab 2 is to test and verify the benefits of new HTTP Protocol (QUIC) comparing to previous 
HTTP Protocols (HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2) by making real web traffics.**

You will get to evaluate the performance of different HTTP protocols by implementing a simple network of your own. 
On top of the KCLOUD account given, you should configure and deploy the following components of the network:
* A Client Machine
* Two Web Servers
* Software switch

and run the two web servers with two different HTTP Protocols (HTTP/2 and QUIC).

After configuration, two tasks will be given for evaluating each protocols:
1. Measuring Handshake Latency and Page-loading Time Evaluation
2. Testing Congestion Control

This github repo **ONLY** contains executables of QUIC server & client.
Full documentation about tasks, configuring the network & HTTP/2 settings is available at "".
